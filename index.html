    <title>The study of CBD</title>

    <h1>What is CBD?</h1>
    <p class="cbd-definition">
      Cannabidiol, or CBD, is the lesser-known child of the cannabis sativa
      plant. With roots in Central Asia, the plant is believed to have been
      first used medicinally — or for rituals — around 750 B.C., though there
      are other estimates too. While CBD is an essential component of medical
      marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant, which is a cousin
      of the marijuana plant. While CBD is a component of marijuana (one of
      hundreds), by itself it does not cause a "high." According to a report
      from the World Health Organization, "In humans, CBD exhibits no effects
      indicative of any abuse or dependence potential…. To date, there is no
      evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure
      CBD."
    </p>
    <h1>What is it used for?</h1>
    <p class="cbd-use">
      CBD is commonly used to address anxiety, and for patients who suffer
      through the misery of insomnia, studies suggest that CBD may help with
      both falling asleep and staying asleep. Sleep can be disrupted for many
      reasons, including depression. CBD may offer an option for treating
      different types of chronic pain.
    </p>
    <h1>How can it affect the body?</h1>
    <p class="cbd-side-effects">
      Though it's often well-tolerated, CBD can cause side effects, such as dry
      mouth, diarrhea, reduced appetite, drowsiness and fatigue. CBD can also
      interact with other medications you're taking, such as blood thinners.
      Another cause for concern is the unreliability of the purity and dosage of
      CBD in products. Side effects also include nausea and irritability.
    </p>
    <h1>What are the benefits of it?</h1>
    <p class="cbd-effects">
      Last year, the F.D.A. approved Epidiolex, a purified CBD extract, to treat
      rare seizure disorders in patients 2 years or older after three
      randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials with 516
      patients that showed the drug, taken along with other medications, helped
      to reduce seizures. These types of studies are the gold standard in
      medicine, in which participants are divided by chance, and neither the
      subject nor the investigator knows which group is taking the placebo or
      the medication.
    </p>
    <h1>Is it legal?</h1>
    <p class="cbd-legality">
      CBD is readily obtainable in most parts of the United States, though its
      exact legal status is in flux. All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD with
      varying degrees of restriction, and while the federal government still
      considers CBD in the same class as marijuana, it doesn’t habitually
      enforce against it. In December 2015, the FDA eased the regulatory
      requirements to allow researchers to conduct CBD trials. Currently, many
      people obtain CBD online without a medical cannabis license. The
      government’s position on CBD is confusing, and depends in part on whether
      the CBD comes from hemp or marijuana. The legality of CBD is expected to
      change, as there is currently bipartisan consensus in Congress to make the
      hemp crop legal which would, for all intents and purposes, make CBD
      difficult to prohibit.
